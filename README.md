# aroma-pong
a simple Pong game in C using libaroma

## History
Some day I was bored, and thought about making a game.  
Nah, really I was doing some test with libaroma, saw that I could manage touch and draw to the screen and that was all, started writing this. 

## Controls
Please understand that this is intended for mobile devices (like Android phones in recovery mode), so controls are adapted for such devices.  
Power button: set default ball speed or restart the game (if it's finished)  
Volume up: increment ball speed  
Volume down: Decrease ball speed  
Select/home button: close the game  
PD: for pause, you can just set the ball speed to zero (the minimum)  

## How to compile
just follow the instructions to build programs using libaroma at https://github.com/MLXProjects/libaroma  
put this repo at libaroma/examples/, build libaroma using the instructions in that link and use either deploy_recovery/android or just build_app

## License
You can use this like you want, don't ask for permission but it would be nice if you mention me when using this code (not a requisite though).  
Libaroma is subject to the Apache 2.0 license, so you should respect it if you want to use libaroma-related source.

## How does it look?
Like this, on my device (samsung galaxy pocket plus, 240x320).
